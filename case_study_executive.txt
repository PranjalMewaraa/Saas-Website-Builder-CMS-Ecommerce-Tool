EXECUTIVE CASE STUDY
SaaS Store Builder

1) WHAT THIS PLATFORM IS
A multi-tenant SaaS product that combines:
- Visual website builder
- Content management and publishing
- Store-scoped e-commerce operations

It enables merchants to go from account signup to a live storefront with catalog and orders from one admin panel.


2) CORE BUSINESS PROBLEM
Small and mid-size brands usually need separate tools for:
- Site creation
- Content editing
- E-commerce operations
- Publishing and previews

This fragmentation increases cost, setup time, and operational errors.


3) SOLUTION SUMMARY
The platform unifies content + commerce in one system with:
- Drag-and-drop visual page editing
- Reusable blocks, templates, and themes
- Snapshot-based publish model (draft vs live)
- Store-scoped catalog (brands/categories/products/variants)
- Cart/order/inventory operations
- Form submissions and operational management screens


4) DIFFERENTIATORS
- True content + commerce unification.
- Multi-tenant architecture with scoped module access.
- Snapshot-based publishing for safer releases.
- Store-scoped catalog model (clean tenant/store isolation).
- Backward compatibility while rolling out V2 commerce.


5) MARKET-FACING CAPABILITIES
For creators/marketers:
- Build and style pages visually
- Manage assets, menus, forms, SEO
- Publish safely with preview controls

For operators/merchants:
- Create stores and catalogs
- Manage products, variants, inventory, orders
- Track submissions and operations in admin


6) PRODUCT STATUS (CURRENT)
Delivered and working:
- Visual builder + block system
- Layout/Section nested architecture
- Theme and style controls
- Menus, forms, assets, SEO
- Publish + preview flow
- Store-scoped commerce V2 foundation
- PDP/cart/order/inventory operational flow

Recent enhancements:
- Footer multi-menu groups with custom titles and typography controls
- Hero preset architecture (Basic/Advanced scaffold)
- Improved layout defaults for visual consistency
- Preview token leakage fix
- Category editing via modal UX + update API


7) TECH STRATEGY (EXECUTIVE LEVEL)
- Content domain in MongoDB
- Commerce domain in MySQL
- Shared renderer and schema system for runtime consistency
- Additive migration strategy to avoid breaking existing customers/data


8) USER VALUE
- Faster launch: one system from design to sales.
- Lower complexity: fewer tools and integrations.
- Safer publishing: draft/live separation.
- Better operations: order, inventory, and submission management in one place.


9) SCALE POTENTIAL
- Horizontal multi-tenant SaaS model
- Extensible block/plugin architecture
- Strong path to vertical presets (fashion/electronics/etc.)
- Expansion into analytics, AI content generation, and advanced commerce automations


10) NEXT STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
- Standardize all catalog edit paths on V2 APIs
- Improve test coverage for publish/order/inventory critical flows
- Expand analytics and business intelligence views
- Harden developer productivity through path consolidation and type cleanup


11) OUTCOME
This project has moved from a builder concept to an operational commerce-ready platform where customers can:
- create a site,
- build pages,
- configure store catalog,
- publish live,
- and run orders/inventory,
without leaving the product ecosystem.
